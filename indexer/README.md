# Juno indexer (Arc)

> **Optional, and unverified on Arc.** The Juno app does not need this indexer. Without `ENVIO_GRAPHQL_URL` it builds trade history, holders and positions from its own transaction receipts plus a bounded tail of `eth_getLogs` (`JUNO_LOG_RANGE`, see `lib/juno/swaps.ts`). This indexer is an add-on for complete history.
>
> What has been checked: `envio codegen`, `tsc` and the handler tests (simulated events, no network) pass with the Arc config. What has **not** been checked: a real `envio dev` / Envio Cloud run against Arc. HyperSync does not cover Arc as far as we know, so the config uses Arc's public JSON-RPC as the primary data source (`rpc: … for: sync`). Envio over a plain RPC on Arc has not been tested end to end, and Juno is not deployed on Arc testnet yet (only a dry run), so the launchpad address and start block are placeholders.

An [Envio HyperIndex](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperIndex/overview) indexer for the Juno launchpad on [Arc](https://arc.network), Circle's USDC-native chain. Every post on Juno launches its own ERC-20 on a bonding curve held by one contract, `JunoLaunchpad`, priced in USDC. A completed curve graduates into the coin's TOKEN/USDC Uniswap v2 pair. This indexer records every launch, curve trade, completion, graduation, pair trade and fee claim (same-chain and cross-chain through CCTP), and serves them over GraphQL.

- `config.yaml`: the contracts, their events, and both Arc networks. Addresses and start blocks come from the environment.
- `schema.graphql`: the entities below.
- `src/EventHandlers.ts`: the handlers. `src/math.ts` holds unit conversion and pricing; `src/quotes.ts` holds the USDC quote (address, 6 decimals) and the pair helpers.
- `test/indexer.test.ts`: handler tests on simulated events. They need no network, database or Docker.

## What it indexes

| Source | Events |
| --- | --- |
| `JunoLaunchpad` (address from env) | `Launched`, `Trade`, `CurveCompleted`, `Graduated`, `CreatorFeesClaimed`, `CreatorFeesBridged`, `ProtocolFeesClaimed`, `QuoteAllowed`, `GraduatorSet`, `ProtocolShareSet` |
| `JunoToken` (every launched token, registered from `Launched`) | `Transfer` |
| `UniswapV2Pair` (each coin's TOKEN/USDC pair, registered from `Launched`) | `Sync`, `Swap` |

Each token and its pair are added to the index when the coin launches (`contractRegister`, a factory pattern; the pair's address is fixed at launch). HyperIndex backfills the whole creation block, so the constructor's mint is seen too. Indexing token transfers is what gives each position a real balance, and each pool a holder count, instead of numbers inferred from trades alone. Swaps on the pair are recorded whichever router sent them (Juno's `JunoSwapRouter` or any other), attributed to the transaction's sender.

### Entities

| Entity | id | What it holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Trade` | `${txHash}:${logIndex}` | One curve buy or sell: trader, side, base, quote, fee and price in display units (also the raw integers), the curve price and quote reserve after it, block and timestamp. |
| `PairTrade` | `${txHash}:${logIndex}` | One swap on a graduated coin's v2 pair: trader (tx sender), side, base, quote, the pair's price after it, block and timestamp. |
| `V2Pair` | pair address | The coin's TOKEN/USDC pair: reserves after the last `Sync`, trade count, volume, last price. |
| `Pool` | token address | Launch parameters (creator, quote, preset, name, symbol, uri, venue, curve bounds, supply split). Live state: sqrt price, spot price, last price, base and quote reserve. Totals: trades, buys, sells, volume, fees, creator fees earned and claimed, holder count. Lifecycle: complete, graduated, liquidity, burned. |
| `Position` | `${trader}-${token}` | One address in one pool. `balance` is the actual ERC-20 balance. `netBase`, `bought`, `sold`, `spent`, `received` and `feesPaid` come from curve and pair trades. It also carries an average-cost basis (`basisBase`, `costBasis`) and `realizedPnl`, using the same policy as the app's `basisFromSwaps`. |
| `Account` | address | Trade, buy, sell and launch counts, pools traded, first seen and last trade. It links to the account's `trades` and `positions`. |
| `QuoteToken` | quote address | One row on Arc: USDC. Decimals (6), whether launches may use it, and pool, trade, volume, fee and protocol-fee totals. |
| `Launchpad` | launchpad address | Graduator, protocol share, and pool, trade, completed and graduated counts. |
| `Graduation` | token address | The migration into the v2 pair: amounts, LP liquidity, amount burned, tx. |
| `CreatorClaim` | `${txHash}:${logIndex}` | A creator withdrawing fees. A cross-chain claim also emits one, with `to` = Circle's TokenMessengerV2. |
| `CreatorFeesBridge` | `${txHash}:${logIndex}` | A cross-chain fee claim through Circle CCTP V2: CCTP destination domain (Base 6, Ethereum 0, Arbitrum 3, …), `mintRecipient` (bytes32), amount and `maxFee` in USDC. Minting on the destination happens after Circle's attestation and is not indexed here. |

**Units.** `BigDecimal` fields are display units. Base amounts are tokens (18 decimals). Quote amounts are **USDC with 6 decimals** (the ERC-20 at `0x3600000000000000000000000000000000000000`, same address on testnet and mainnet), so every quote amount, price and volume is also a USD amount. Arc's native balance is the same USDC with 18 decimals, but the launchpad never uses it: there is no native quote. Fields ending in `Raw`, plus `sqrtPriceX96` and `liquidity`, are the contract's own integers. Prices are USDC per token, kept to 30 significant digits.

**Serialisation.** Envio's Hasura returns `BigInt` and `BigDecimal` as strings, and `Int` as a number. Filter on addresses with their EIP-55 checksummed form, which is what the indexer stores.

**Chains.** Rows are per chain (`disable_default_cross_chain: true`), so every entity has a generated `chainId`. If one deployment indexes both networks, add `chainId: {_eq: 5042002}` (or `5042`) to your `where`.

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it in. Envio only passes through variables that start with `ENVIO_`, and Envio Cloud only accepts that prefix, so the app's names are prefixed here. The launchpad address and start block come from the deployment record `deployments/arc-<network>.json` (`launchpad`, `deployBlock`).

| Variable | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ENVIO_JUNO_TESTNET_LAUNCHPAD` | `0x0…0` (placeholder) | `launchpad` from `deployments/arc-testnet.json`. Not deployed yet. The local fork's launchpad (`.fork/arc-fork.json`) is valid on the fork only. |
| `ENVIO_JUNO_TESTNET_START_BLOCK` | `0` (placeholder) | `deployBlock` from the same file. |
| `ENVIO_ARC_TESTNET_RPC_URL` | `https://rpc.testnet.arc.io` | Primary data source for chain 5042002. |
| `ENVIO_ARC_RPC_BLOCK_INTERVAL` | `2000` | Blocks per `eth_getLogs` to start with. |
| `ENVIO_ARC_RPC_BLOCK_CEILING` | `9000` | Upper bound. The public testnet RPC answers a 10,000-block range and refuses a larger one ("requested range too large", checked 2026-10-08). |
| `ENVIO_JUNO_SKIP_MAINNET` | `true` | Set to `false` once there is a mainnet launchpad. |
| `ENVIO_JUNO_MAINNET_LAUNCHPAD` | `0x0…0` | `launchpad` from `deployments/arc-mainnet.json`. |
| `ENVIO_JUNO_MAINNET_START_BLOCK` | `0` | `deployBlock` from the same file. |
| `ENVIO_ARC_MAINNET_RPC_URL` | `https://rpc.mainnet.arc.io` | Primary data source for chain 5042. |

> **The start block must not be later than the launchpad's deployment.** The constructor emits `ProtocolShareSet` and `QuoteAllowed(USDC)`, and pools inherit the fee split from those. A trade on a pool whose `Launched` event was missed is skipped with an error log. Unlike HyperSync, an RPC source does not skip empty ranges cheaply: leaving the start block at `0` makes the indexer walk Arc from genesis (tens of millions of blocks, thousands of `eth_getLogs` calls), so set it.
>
> **Finality.** Arc has sub-second deterministic finality, so a block the RPC returns is final; reorg handling is moot.

## Run it locally

Prerequisites: Node 22 or later (24 is recommended), pnpm, and Docker. Docker runs Postgres and Hasura for `envio dev`.

```bash
cd indexer
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env        # then set the launchpad address and start block
pnpm dev                    # envio dev: codegen, start Postgres + Hasura, index over Arc's RPC
```

No `ENVIO_API_TOKEN` is needed: the RPC is the data source, not HyperSync. GraphQL is served at `http://localhost:8080/v1/graphql`. The Hasura console is at `http://localhost:8080` and the admin secret is `testing`. After changing `config.yaml` or `schema.graphql`, restart from scratch with `pnpm envio dev -r`. Stop everything with `pnpm stop`.

To index the local Arc fork instead (`scripts/arc-fork.sh`, `http://127.0.0.1:8910`, same chain id 5042002), point `ENVIO_ARC_TESTNET_RPC_URL` at it and take the launchpad and `deployBlock` from `.fork/arc-fork.json`. Not tried.

Checks that need no Docker or network:

```bash
pnpm codegen     # validates config.yaml + schema.graphql, regenerates .envio/types.d.ts
pnpm typecheck   # tsc over handlers and tests
pnpm test        # vitest: simulated events through the real handlers
```

## Host it on Envio Cloud

1. Sign in at <https://envio.dev/app> with GitHub. Pick an organisation and install the Envio Deployments GitHub app on this repository.
2. **Add indexer**. Set the root directory to `indexer`, the config file to `config.yaml`, and choose a deployment branch (for example `envio`).
3. Under **Settings → Environment Variables**, set the `ENVIO_*` variables from the table above.
4. Push to the deployment branch. Each push builds a new deployment that re-indexes from the start block.
5. Copy the deployment's GraphQL endpoint from the dashboard.

Whether Envio Cloud accepts an RPC-only chain it has no HyperSync for (Arc) has not been checked. Envio Cloud needs the `envio` version pinned in `package.json` (it is `3.12.1`) and a pnpm lockfile (`pnpm-lock.yaml` is committed). See [the deployment docs](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/HyperIndex/hosted-service-deployment).

## Mainnet

Arc mainnet is chain **5042**, RPC `https://rpc.mainnet.arc.io`, explorer `https://explorer.arc.io`; USDC is at the same `0x3600…0000`. The mainnet chain is in `config.yaml` but skipped (`ENVIO_JUNO_SKIP_MAINNET=true`) until Juno is deployed there and `deployments/arc-mainnet.json` has a `launchpad` and `deployBlock`. Then set `ENVIO_JUNO_SKIP_MAINNET=false`, `ENVIO_JUNO_MAINNET_LAUNCHPAD` and `ENVIO_JUNO_MAINNET_START_BLOCK`. The mainnet RPC's `eth_getLogs` range limit has not been checked; adjust the block interval variables if it refuses ranges.

## How the app uses it

Set the endpoint in the app's root `.env.local`:

```bash
ENVIO_GRAPHQL_URL=http://localhost:8080/v1/graphql   # or an Envio Cloud endpoint
```

`lib/juno/envio.ts` then reads from here instead of from the receipt record and the bounded log tail: `Trade` and `PairTrade` (by `token` or `trader`, ordered by `blockNumber`, `logIndex`), `Position` (holders by token, positions by trader), `Pool` (`holderCount tradeCount volumeQuote`) and `_meta`. Each trade row maps onto `PoolSwap` with `Number(...)`.

### Example queries

A token's curve trades, newest first (this is the query the app runs):

```graphql
query TokenTrades($token: String!) {
  Trade(
    where: { token: { _eq: $token } }
    order_by: [{ blockNumber: desc }, { logIndex: desc }]
    limit: 200
  ) {
    id txHash logIndex token trader isBuy
    baseAmount quoteAmount fee price
    blockNumber timestamp
  }
}
```

After graduation, the same coin's trades on its v2 pair:

```graphql
query PairTrades($token: String!) {
  PairTrade(where: { token: { _eq: $token } }, order_by: [{ blockNumber: desc }, { logIndex: desc }], limit: 200) {
    id txHash logIndex token trader isBuy baseAmount quoteAmount price blockNumber timestamp
  }
}
```

A wallet's portfolio: what it holds, what it paid, and what it has realised:

```graphql
query Portfolio($trader: String!) {
  Position(
    where: { trader: { _eq: $trader }, balance: { _gt: "0" } }
    order_by: { balance: desc }
  ) {
    token balance
    basisBase costBasis realizedPnl
    spentQuote receivedQuote tradeCount lastTradeAt
    pool { name symbol quoteDecimals spotPrice graduated }
  }
}
```

The value of a position (in USDC) is `balance × pool.spotPrice`. Average cost is `costBasis / basisBase`.

Top pools by volume (USDC):

```graphql
query TopPools {
  Pool(order_by: { volumeQuote: desc }, limit: 20) {
    id name symbol creator
    volumeQuote tradeCount holderCount
    spotPrice quoteReserve migrationQuoteThreshold
    complete graduated
  }
}
```

Progress to graduation is `quoteReserve / migrationQuoteThreshold`. Market cap is `spotPrice × 1,000,000,000`.

Creator fees sent cross-chain:

```graphql
query Bridged($creator: String!) {
  CreatorFeesBridge(where: { creator: { _eq: $creator } }, order_by: { blockNumber: desc }) {
    token destinationDomain mintRecipient amount maxFee txHash timestamp
  }
}
```

Whether the indexer has caught up:

```graphql
{ _meta { chainId progressBlock sourceBlock isReady } }
```

## Notes

- **`balance` and `netBase` can differ.** `balance` follows every ERC-20 transfer. `netBase` counts only trades. A wallet that received tokens by transfer holds them with no cost basis, and selling them realises nothing (the app's policy). The launchpad's own inventory and the zero address are never positions.
- **Holder count** counts addresses with a positive balance, excluding the launchpad and the coin's v2 pair (which holds the liquidity after graduation).
- **After graduation**, `Pool.spotPrice` stays at the curve's final price; the live price is `V2Pair.lastPrice` (or the latest `PairTrade.price`). A pair trade's fee is estimated from v2's 0.3% and counted in USDC.
