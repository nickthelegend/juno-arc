/**

 * Nothing streams OHLC for a Juno pool: there is no exchange behind it. What
 * exists is every executed swap, decoded from the launchpad's own `Trade`
 * events, and a candle is those swaps grouped by time — first
 * price open, last close, extremes high and low, quote size summed into volume.
 * Real candles over real fills, not a shape fitted to a line.
