 * Arc (EVM) addresses, as the app compares and checks them.

 * number of equivalent ones — all lower case from a pasted link, all upper
 * case from someone's QR code. The server answers in checksummed form and
 * viem produces checksummed form, but a route param is whatever was typed.
 * Comparing two of them with `===` said "not you" on your own profile the
 * first time a lower-cased link was opened, so every comparison goes through
 * here instead.

 * the server normalises the same way, with `getAddress`.
