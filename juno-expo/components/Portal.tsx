/**
 * Render something at the root of the app rather than where it is written.
 *
 * A bottom sheet fills its parent. Written at a screen's root, the parent is
 * the screen and the sheet covers it; written inside a card on a scrolling page
 * — a price alert, a weekly buy — the parent was the
 * card, so the sheet hung off the card's bottom edge mid-page, scrolled with
 * it, and had no backdrop over the rest of the screen. Hoisting it here makes
 * where a sheet is written and where it appears two separate questions.
 *
 * The host sits inside every provider the app has (wallet, theme, safe
 * area, gestures), so nothing a sheet reads from context is lost on the way.
 * Without a host — a sheet rendered above it — `Portal` renders in place.
