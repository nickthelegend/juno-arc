/**
 * A sheet that comes up from the bottom, and can be thrown back down.
 *
 * ## Why this is not `Modal animationType="slide"`
 *
 * The platform slide is a fixed linear-ish ramp with no backdrop, no grabber
 * and no gesture. It cannot be interrupted, so a finger arriving mid-animation
 * is ignored until the slide finishes — which is the moment someone is most
 * likely to change their mind. Here the same `translateY` drives the opening
 * spring *and* the drag, so a finger can catch the sheet in flight and the
 * spring picks up from wherever it was let go.
 *
 * It is not wrapped in `Modal` either. On iOS a `Modal` is presented in its own
 * `UIWindow`, which put the sheet outside the ordinary view tree and made the
 * drag untestable. What `Modal` was providing — covering the tab bar, and the
 * Android back button — is a sibling rendered after `<Tabs>` and a
 * `BackHandler` subscription.
 *
 * ## The drag is a native recognizer, not `PanResponder`
 *
 * `PanResponder` negotiates on the JS thread, and in this app that is the wrong
 * thread to bet a gesture on: a feed read walks every pool against a
 * rate-limited RPC and can hold JS for most of a minute. A drawer that ignores
 * your finger while a list loads is worse than one that does not drag at all.
 * `Gesture.Pan()` recognises natively, so the sheet answers the finger whatever
 * JS is doing — and it composes with the scroll views a sheet's contents will
 * eventually hold, which `PanResponder` does not.
 *
 * ## The motion, and why each number
 *
 * - **Open is a spring, close is a curve.** Opening is physical: a surface
 *   arriving and settling. Closing is the system getting out of the way, so it
 *   is a 230ms ease-out — shorter than the spring that opened it, because a
 *   sheet that takes as long to leave as it took to arrive feels like it is
 *   arguing.
 * - **The backdrop tracks the sheet.** Its opacity is interpolated from the
 *   same value, so dragging halfway down lightens the scrim halfway. Fading it
 *   on a separate timer is the detail that makes a drag feel like it is moving
 *   a real object rather than triggering two animations.
 * - **Up has friction, not a wall.** Dragging above the resting position moves
 *   at 14% of the finger. Nothing in the world stops dead, and an outright
 *   block reads as a bug.
 * - **A flick counts.** Release past 28% of the height *or* faster than
 *   0.55px/ms dismisses. Distance alone punishes the gesture people actually
 *   make, which is short and fast.
 *
 * Everything animated here is `transform` or `opacity` on the native driver,
 * so the drag stays smooth while JS is busy — which, in this app, it often is.
