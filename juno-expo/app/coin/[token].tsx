/**
 * One coin: what it is, what it costs, and how to trade it.
 *
 * ## Why the chart is the whole top of the screen
 *
 * Every other arrangement of this page buried the price in a card among other
 * cards, which is a claim that the price is one fact of several. It is not —
 * it is the reason anyone opened the screen. So it is edge to edge, with no
 * container around it, and everything else is arranged underneath in the order
 * the questions actually get asked: *what is this*, *how big is it*, *who else
 * is here*, *what are the details*.
 *
 * ## Why the rest is tabbed rather than stacked
 *
 * Activity, holders, comments and metadata are four answers to four different
 * questions, and only one is wanted at a time. Stacked, they made the page
 * thousands of points long and pushed the buy button off the bottom of it;
 * tabbed, the action bar is always in reach and the page never changes height
 * when a slow read lands.
 *
 * ## The NAV band and the savings card
 *
 * Both live under **Details**, because that is what they are: facts about this
 * instrument rather than about its market. The watch toggle stays in the nav
 * bar, where it is one tap from anywhere on the page.
 *
 * ## A curve's three lives
 *
 * Trading on the curve, full and waiting, and graduated. A full curve takes no
 * trades until someone sends the graduation transaction that moves its
 * reserves into the Uniswap v2 pair — and anyone may, so the Buy button
 * becomes Graduate rather than disappearing. The creator also gets a Claim
 * for the fees their coin has earned — on Arc, or straight to another chain
 * through Circle CCTP V2 — and nobody else sees it.
 *
 * ## Arc
 *
 * A graduated coin gets a Cross-chain card: its creator can make it a
 * Chainlink CCIP Cross-Chain Token in one transaction, and holders can then
 * send it to Base or Ethereum. A tracker shows its Chainlink reference — NAV,
 * implied price, premium and band — above the tabs, and every dollar figure
 * here is USDC, with its Chainlink peg beside the market cap.
