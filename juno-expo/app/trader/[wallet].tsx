 * Someone's profile, as anyone sees it: who they are, what they launched as a

 * their record from the leaderboard.
 *
 * Every launch opens its coin, and Buy on the header opens a buy of their
 * biggest coin at *your* size against the live curve. Copying is that and no
 * more: it does not mirror their future trades, which would need spending
 * authority this project does not ask for.
 *
 * Your own wallet here is your profile as you see it (Edit profile), without
 * the wallet tab, which lives on the Profile tab.
