/**
 * Seed creator posts for the social feed.
 *
 * The feed mixes real trades with what creators wrote. Trades come from the
 * chain and are only there if someone traded; posts have to exist. A demo that
 * opens on an empty feed reads as a broken app rather than a quiet one, so the
 * post half is what guarantees the first screen has something on it.
 *
 * Posts are attached to coins that actually exist on this network, so every
 * "about $TICKER" link resolves to a real market. Idempotent: a post whose text
 * is already in the feed is skipped.
 *
 *   npm run juno:seed-posts
 *   npm run juno:seed-posts -- --author 0x…
 *
 * Needs the API running (npm run dev, :3100), or JUNO_API_URL pointing at a
 * deployment. Posts are attributed to `--author`, else to the script wallet —
 * the same key that launched the demo coins, so the feed's authors are
 * accounts that really did something. Nothing is signed.
 *
 * Talks to the app over HTTP rather than importing the data layer:
 * `lib/juno/posts.ts` and the registry are `server-only`, which throws outside
 * Next's bundler (see `scripts/lib/cli.ts`) — and going through the API means
 * the seed exercises the same endpoint the phone does.
