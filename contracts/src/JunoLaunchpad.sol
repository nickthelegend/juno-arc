/// @title JunoLaunchpad
/// @notice Every post is a market, on Arc. Publishing a post launches a token
/// whose entire supply is sold on a sixteen-segment bonding curve quoted in
/// USDC (Arc's gas token, 6 decimals on its ERC-20 face); the creator earns the
/// trading fees and can withdraw them to any CCTP chain in one call; when the
/// curve fills, its reserves graduate into a Uniswap v2 pair whose liquidity
/// is locked for good.
///
/// ## Arc specifics
///
/// - Quotes are ERC-20 only (USDC at 0x3600…0000; the owner may also allow
///   EURC). There is no native-coin path: on Arc the native balance *is* USDC
///   with 18 decimals, and mixing the two faces in one pool is how pools go
///   insolent. `msg.value` is refused everywhere.
/// - `buyWithAuthorization`: the buyer signs one EIP-3009 authorization and
///   anyone (Juno's relayer) submits it, so a buyer whose USDC just arrived
///   through Circle Gateway buys without holding gas or approving first.
/// - `claimCreatorFeesCrossChain`: creator fees leave through Circle CCTP V2
///   straight to the creator's wallet on Base, Ethereum, Solana…
/// - Each curve's raise is capped (`maxRaise`), so no single pool can pool
///   more USDC than the owner has allowed.
///
/// ## The curve
///
/// A curve is a start price and sixteen ranges above it, each with its own
/// liquidity. The liquidity in a range sets how much supply that stretch of the
/// curve absorbs per unit of price — so the sixteen weights are the character
/// of a launch. Back-loaded weights make a content coin (cheap to enter, steep
/// late); front-loaded weights make a thin listed name (a deep book at the
/// issue price); a book shape makes an IPO (depth at both ends, discovery in
/// the middle); uniform weights make a tracker that should not drift.
///
/// The curve itself is computed off-chain (`lib/juno/curves.ts`) and validated
/// here: prices strictly increasing, liquidity non-zero, and the supply the
/// curve sells plus the supply reserved for migration must fit inside the
/// fixed one-billion-token supply. The quote the curve raises by its top is
/// the migration threshold, computed here from the ranges rather than trusted
/// from the caller.
///
/// ## Price continuity at graduation
///
/// The base reserved for migration is the threshold priced at the curve's top.
/// The AMM therefore opens at exactly the price the curve finished on: nobody
/// can buy the last token on the curve and sell it into the pair for a
/// guaranteed profit.
///
/// ## Fees
///
/// Charged in the quote token on both sides. They decay exponentially from a
/// launch fee, which blunts snipers in the first minutes, to a resting fee,
/// over sixty periods. The protocol takes a share fixed at launch; the creator
/// takes the rest, claimable at any time.
