 * Rate limiting for the endpoints where a stranger's requests cost Juno

 * project's key).
 *
 * Deliberately in-process: a fixed-window counter in a Map, no Redis, no extra
 * infrastructure to run. Each server instance keeps its own counter, so the
 * effective limit is `limit × instances` and it resets on restart. That is a
 * real weakness against a distributed attacker; it still turns "unbounded"
 * into "bounded per instance". Swap the store for Redis behind the same
 * `check()` signature if that gap ever matters.
