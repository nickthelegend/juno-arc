/**
 * Juno's bonding-curve presets, and the builder that turns one into the exact
 * arguments `JunoLaunchpad.launch` takes.
 *
 * This is the part of Juno that is not a memecoin launchpad. A Juno curve is a
 * start price and sixteen ranges above it, each holding its own liquidity, and
 * the weights across those ranges are what give a launch its character:
 *
 *   more liquidity in a range  →  more supply absorbed per unit of price
 *                             →  a flatter stretch of curve
 *
 * A memecoin launch back-loads its weights: nearly free at the start, near
 * vertical at the end, graduate as fast as possible. An equity-like launch
 * wants the opposite properties in different places — a deep book near the
 * issue price so early size does not gap the print, real price discovery in
 * the middle, and a flattening near the target cap so the pool does not moon
 * away from the underlying before it graduates.
 *
 * ## The solve
 *
 * Given a start and end valuation and sixteen weights, the builder places the
 * range boundaries geometrically between the two prices and then solves for
 * the one liquidity scale at which
 *
 *     supply sold on the curve + supply reserved for the AMM = 99% of supply
 *
 * where the AMM's share is the quote the curve raises, priced at the curve's
 * top. That last clause is what makes graduation continuous: the pair opens at
 * exactly the price the curve finished on. The remaining 1% is a rounding
 * buffer the launchpad burns at graduation.
 *
 * This is the same solve Meteora's `buildCurveWithLiquidityWeights` performs
 * for its Dynamic Bonding Curve — Juno ran on DBC before it ran on EVM chains, and
 * the four presets below are unchanged. What changed is who enforces it: the
 * curve is now checked by Juno's own contract (`contracts/src/JunoLaunchpad.sol`),
 * and `curveTotals` below runs the contract's arithmetic so a curve that
 * would revert fails here first.
