/**
 * Trade history, read from the launchpad's own `Trade` events.
 *
 * Every buy and sell emits one, with the trader, both amounts, the fee and the
 * price it left behind — so a fill's side and size are facts the contract
 * stated, not something reconstructed from balance changes.
 *
 * ## Getting them without hammering the RPC
 *
 * A public endpoint bounds `eth_getLogs` ranges (`JUNO_LOG_RANGE`, 10,000
 * blocks by default on Arc). So history arrives three ways, cheapest first:
 *
 * 1. **The receipt.** Every trade made in the app is submitted by this server,
 *    which reads its `Trade` log from the receipt and records it on the spot.
 *    The chart moves the moment the transaction confirms.
 * 2. **The log tail.** One cursor for the whole launchpad walks forward a few
 *    ranges per request, catching trades made anywhere else — another app, a
 *    script, a direct contract call.
 * 3. **Envio.** When `ENVIO_GRAPHQL_URL` points at the HyperIndex deployment in
 *    `indexer/`, history comes from there instead: complete from the
 *    launchpad's first block, whatever the RPC allows.
 *
 * A history that the tail has not caught up on is reported `partial`, and the
 * UI says so rather than presenting a prefix as the whole story.
