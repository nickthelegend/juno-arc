/**
 * Surviving a public RPC endpoint.
 *
 * Juno runs against Arc's public RPC unless `ARC_RPC_URL` names a
 * dedicated one, and a public endpoint rate-limits a burst hard enough to
 * break a demo. viem's own transport retry is switched off (`retryCount: 0` in
 * `lib/juno/client.ts`) so that retrying is this module's job instead, with a
 * budget the caller chooses.
 *
 * Two rules learned the hard way:
 *
 * Only retry what retrying can fix. A 429 or a 503 is a "come back later"; a
 * reverted call or a malformed request is not, and hammering it wastes the
 * exact budget the real failure needs.
 *
 * Never let one failed page discard the pages that succeeded. A partial answer
 * from a rate-limited endpoint is worth more than an empty one, provided the
 * caller can tell the difference — which is why `collect` reports both.
