 * the single most useful thing a trader can know about a curve, because it is
 * the whole difference between the four presets this app offers.
 *
 * Both functions here quote against the *live* curve through the launchpad's
 * own `quoteBuy` / `quoteSell` — the same arithmetic `buy` and `sell` run.
 * Nothing is modelled or approximated. The probes of one round are issued
 * together, and viem folds them into a single Multicall3 `eth_call`, so a
 * twelve-point chart is one round trip rather than twelve.
