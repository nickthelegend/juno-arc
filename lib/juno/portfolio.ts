/**
 * What a wallet holds, and what it paid.
 *
 * The balance is read from each token's `balanceOf` — that is the truth about
 * ownership. The *cost* is not on the balance anywhere, so it is derived
 * from the same decoded swap history that drives the charts: every buy this
 * wallet made against a Juno pool added tokens at a known price, every sell
 * removed them.
 *
 * ## Average cost, and why
 *
 * Realised P&L needs a lot matching policy, and the honest ones disagree with
 * each other — FIFO and average cost give different answers for the same
 * trades. This uses **average cost**: a sell reduces the position and the cost
 * basis proportionally, leaving the average unchanged.
 *
 * That choice matters because it is the one that cannot mislead here. FIFO
 * would let a creator realise a gain by selling their earliest, cheapest tokens
 * while the position is underwater overall — a number that is technically true
 * and tells the holder the opposite of their actual situation.
 *
 * ## What this cannot see
 *
 * Tokens acquired any way other than a swap against the pool — an airdrop, a
 * transfer from a friend, a buy made before the visible history window — are
 * held but have no recorded cost. Those are reported with a null cost basis
 * rather than a zero, because a zero cost implies the entire holding is profit.
