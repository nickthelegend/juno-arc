 * Arc's finality is deterministic, so a block is final when produced.
 *
 * Polled by the app about once a second: a poll works the same on iOS, Android
 * and the web, and the server holds the one WebSocket to the chain rather than
 * every phone opening its own. The first request opens it, so the very first
 * answer may be empty and say `connected: false` — which is the truth.
