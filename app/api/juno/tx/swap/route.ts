/**
 * Build an unsigned swap for a coin.
 *
 * The client sends what it wants to trade; it gets back the transactions to
 * sign (an approval first when a USDC buy needs one), the quote they were
 * built against, and the deadline after which the launchpad refuses them. It
 * signs on-device and posts each step to `/api/juno/tx/submit`, in order.
 *
 * Only coins Juno launched can be traded here, so the token is looked up in
 * the registry first. The registry is not what the transaction is built from,
 * though: `buildSwap` reads the pool from the launchpad itself, and that read
 * is the source of truth for the curve, the quote token and whether the curve
 * is still open. There is no pool address to accept from the caller at all —
 * on Arc a pool is keyed by its token inside the launchpad.
