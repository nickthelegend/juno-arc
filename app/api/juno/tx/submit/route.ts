 * Submit a transaction the device signed, and wait for it to confirm.
 *
 * `POST {signed}` where `signed` is the serialized, signed EIP-1559
 * transaction as `0x…` hex — exactly what viem's `signTransaction` returns.
 *
 * This server never holds the key that signed these bytes. It checks the chain
 * id, broadcasts them, waits for the receipt (on Arc a receipt is final:
 * deterministic sub-second finality), records any trades the receipt carries, and drops the caches for
 * the pools that just moved so the next read is live. A launch comes back with
 * `launched`, which is the app's cue to index the coin with `POST pools`. The
 * answer carries `confirmMs` (broadcast → receipt), `explorerUrl`, the Memo tag
 * when the call went through Arc's Memo, `cctp` for a cross-chain fee claim,
 * and `ccipMessageId` / `ccipExplorerUrl` for a Chainlink CCIP send.
 *
 * Steps from one build must be submitted in order, each after the previous one
 * answered: their nonces are consecutive, and a later one sent first is only
 * held by the node until the gap fills.
