/**
 * What one wallet holds of one token.
 *
 * The buy sheet calls its balance line "the number that decides whether any of
 * the rest is possible". The portfolio endpoint knows coin balances but not the
 * *quote* side, which is the side a buy spends from — so this answers both.
 *
 * On Arc the account's native balance *is* USDC (the gas token), in 18
 * decimals; asked for with the zero address it is reported as USDC. It is the
 * same money as the 6-decimal ERC-20 at 0x3600… — never add the two. Anything
 * else is an ERC-20 `balanceOf`, with its `decimals` and `symbol` read alongside so the
 * number can be scaled and labelled. The three reads go out together and the
 * shared client folds them into one Multicall3 `eth_call`.
 *
 * `null` rather than `0` when the read fails, for the reason everything here
 * returns null: "we could not look" is not "you have nothing", and only one of
 * those should grey out the button. `symbol` and `decimals` are null only in
 * the same case, for a token this server does not already know.
 *
 * `GET ?wallet=&token=`.
