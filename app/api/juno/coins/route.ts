 * The market list: every Juno coin on this network, priced.
 *

 * history — because a grid shows none of them and each one is another call
 * against an endpoint that throttles. What is left is one launchpad read per
 * coin, and the shared client batches those into Multicall3.
 *
 * `?sort=marketCap|graduating|memes`. `memes` is the posts and reels only —
 * every coin that tracks nothing — for comparing curves as a list rather than
 * scrolling a feed. Unknown values leave the registry's newest-first order.
