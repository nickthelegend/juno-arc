 * sizes and, when `impact` is given, the largest trade that stays under it.
 *
 * Every point is the launchpad's own `quoteBuy` / `quoteSell` — the arithmetic
 * `buy` and `sell` run — not a model of it. The probes of one round go out
 * together and the shared client folds them into a single Multicall3
 * `eth_call`, so a twelve-point chart is one round trip.
